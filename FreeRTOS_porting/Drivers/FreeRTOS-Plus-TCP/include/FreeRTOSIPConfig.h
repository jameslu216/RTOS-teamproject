 ***   FreeRTOS+TCP is functional and has been used in commercial products   ***
 ***   for some time.  Be aware however that we are still refining its       ***
 ***   design, the source code does not yet quite conform to the strict      ***
 ***   coding and style standards mandated by Real Time Engineers ltd., and  ***
 ***   the documentation and testing is not necessarily complete.            ***

 * License.  If FreeRTOS+TCP is used on any other processor, then it can be used
 * under the terms of the GNU General Public License V2.  Links to the relevant
 * licenses follow:

/*Optional: ipconfigPACKET_FILLER_SIZE This option is a bit tricky:
it makes sure that all 32-bit fields in the network packets are 32-bit aligned.
This means that the 14-byte Ethernet header should start at a 16-bit offset.
Therefore ipconfigPACKET_FILLER_SIZE is defined a 2 (bytes).
I think that most EMAC's have an option to set this 2-byte offset for both incoming and outgoing packets.*/
